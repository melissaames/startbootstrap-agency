<p class="text-left"> Nestie enables apartment seekers to find their next apartment from departing tenants instead of brokers. Based on our research we looked into these areas of opportunity; communicating the value propostion of Nestie, creating a verification process, and building out a secure and transparent payment process. To UX these opportunities we conducted user research, competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. 
</p>
                            <h4>Research:</h4>
<p class="text-left">We jumped into research, looking specifically at other peer to peer sights to see common themes. We broke down findings from various sites to see their payment flows, verification methods. We conducted contextual inquiries to see how users were interacting with the current Nestie site. After gather the mass of information, we worked to synthesize findings and pull out general themes to aid us in the redesign. Findings allowed us to understand that overall users did not understand the portrayal of value proposition.</p>

                           <h4>Design: </h4>
<p class="text-left">Building off the existing platform, we began implementing features and building in new pages. Once the mid-fi pages had been completed, we made a prototype to test on users. Taking careful note of how users interacted with the initial prototype and listening to any feedback they had to offer, we synthesized results and began on the second iteration. We went through the same process for the second prototype, which lead us to the final prototype.

<br>The final prototype included; verification badges to indicate to users this is a safe platform, the reworked inbox page to better demonstrate its use as a thread for a specific apartment, and a progress bar to show the transparency that Nestie offers. </p>

                            <h4>Overview:</h4> 
<p class="text-left">Looking into an area of opportunity for an existing brand, my team and I landed on a stationary subscription box. Starting with a card sort to narrow down our own interests, we saw overlap in a few areas. Sticking to these areas we pitched our strongest four ideas, and decided to build out Noteable. Noteable is a stationary subscription service that acts as a sister website to the art supply store, Blick.</p>
                            <h4>Research:</h4>
<p class="text-left">Our team then began to tackle initial research to see what was already out there. We found our top competitors/comparatives and executed user flows, content blocking, and feature comparison.<br>

Looking to compare sites already carrying out an idea close to ours we analyzed tasks flows to see how many steps it would take to achieve a specific task. Specifically we looked at how many steps it takes to join or subscribe and how it works/description. We noted for ease of use we needed to have an accessible subscribe button. <br>

To have an idea where to start when designing our site, we performed the task of comparative content blocking. This gave us an idea of how it was working for others and where we should differ.<br.

Having that information we went on to see who our users would be. To expand on what we found in the survey, we conducted user interviews. From these interviews we found that people shop out of necessity and out of want. We found common themes between individuals that enjoyed getting subscription boxes because they were convenient when busy, enjoyable to open (a gift unveiling experience), and introduction to new products. From this we pulled out common themes, using affinity mapping, to come up with user identities that we could base our service around.</p>

                            <p class="text-left">Looking at our competitors our team decided our best option was to create a responsive website. Based on all the research we had compiled, we began to the initial sketching process. Sketching out our vision of Noteable, we compiled elements and put together mi-fi wireframes. Building out Noteable, we made sure to include a quiz so users could personalize their boxes, ways to easily repurchase items, and view and buy items sold in the boxes.  We had users test out our initial prototype to find areas of opportunity. We heard feedback that indicated that the design needed fine tuning, but the flow was the piece that needed the most work. We went back to sketching and iterating on the existing pages, we built out more pages to increase ease of use and any user confusion with the flow.</p>

In order to keep up with the competitors, Hotel Tonight being a last minute hotel booking application needs to focus on increasing the return rate of existing users and likewise increase the rate of new users. In a feedback loop, Hotel Tonight wants to increase the number of rooms being sold which will encourage more hotels to offer rooms and increase the room availability to consumers.</p>

                            <h4>Research: </h4> 
                            <p class="text-left">Having received the area of opportunity we dove into researching how to define and tackle the problems. By developing a initial screener and survey, it helped us familiarize ourselves with the users behaviors. We asked a few basic questions that had to do with how/when/why a user books travel accommodations. We aggregated this information and pulled out a few common themes.

After gathering this information we went onto comparative and competitive analysis to see what was already out there and why it was doing well.

From these side by side comparison we found elements that were common and began devising a plan of action. Items that were common across the board included: a sorting feature(to sort by price, location, etc.), collect a list of favorites or wish list hotels, and a calendar feature to compare price trends.

</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melissaames/startbootstrap-agency/gh-pages/images/Flow.png" alt="">
                            <h4>Design:</h4> 
<p class="text-left">Once we put the screens into InVision to make a clickable prototype, we began rounds of user testing. Overall we found that users were having trouble navigating through the tasks because of unfamiliarity of icons, and lack direction on our part (as we didn’t add hotel names which lead to confusion to where they should be clicking). Readability was also an issue.

Coming back in with a different approach we aimed to revise the areas of confusion. It was clear we needed to change the existing logos in the nav bar, reorganize what remained and what should be added to the nav bar, and added text to be able to differentiate between hotels.

We then went through another round of user testing, which provided more promising feedback. Users more easily could navigate through the interface. Users picked up on the idea of favoriting a hotel and then having saved into the heart or “favorites” tab. There still were a few things to be improved on: the briefcase in the bottom nav was confused as a calendar, the calendar icon didn’t indicate price trends, and icons and text needs to be increased.

Taking the notes we did a final reworking of our prototype and took it up to a hi-fidelity mockup. We ironed out the last few problem areas. We increased size of icons and text to help with readability and usability. Finally, we broke down the price trends and calendar feature into two different tabs to ensure ease of use.</p>
